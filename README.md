# mean-shift-for-dominant-color-hex-code-
An unsupervised learning algorithim 'Mean Shift' has been used to find the centroid of the largest cluster of an image and thus the 
centroid is the dominant color of the image. Two functions has been defined to find the centroid of the largest cluster and the other 
function to convert the dominant color in to the hex code.

# environments
1) windows 7

2) Python 3

3) libraries( scikit_learn, numpy, openCV, collections and base24)

# workflow

1) download the code and open in jupyter notebook

2) install( if libraries are not installed yet) and import the necessary libraraies

3) give apprpriate address of the image which dominant color is to be find out

4) run the code and train the model

5) plot the images and its corrosponding dominant color
